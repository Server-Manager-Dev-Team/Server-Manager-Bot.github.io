Hey everyone, so first of all i'd like to say sorry we didn't do this sooner, but we have now released our new beta bot! It has all of the features that the normal bot does but we will start to add the stuff we want on to beta to test and then add to the main! Thid bot can be invited by anyone by clicking the button below

<div className="pyc-hero__actions">
  <Button link="https://discord.gg/6bCKvP24kb">Beta Bot Invite</Button>
</div>

But some things that we need to say, with making the beta bot, we ran into some problems:

<div className="box red animation no-background">
<div className="title">
Problems
</div>
<li>Premium was not transferred over as bot has premium commans enabled for all</li>
â†’ <em>(Thats all that we know)</em>
</div>

But last thing, both bots will be updated at the same time, so if we add a new feature to one bot we will try and add it to the other! So join out support server and add the bot!
