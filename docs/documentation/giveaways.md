## FAQ
  
### Why can't I remove giveaway entries? {#removing-giveaway-entries}
The reason you can't do this is supported by many ways how a giveaway can be rigged if a manage giveaway entries feature is added. We believe in fair giveaways and no giveaway entries are removed. We understand that some giveaway hosts may want to enforce a custom requirement manually. However, this is why the `/giveaway reroll` command exists and allows you to re-roll the giveaway an unlimited amount of times. Thus, removing the audacity to manage giveaway entries. In the `/giveaway view` command, we may (sooner than later) allow giveaway entries to be viewed but not managed.

<div className="box blurple animation no-background">
<span className="blurple-background">NEW</span> You can now view giveaway entries by pressing the <strong>x Entries</strong> button (<a className="discord-link" href="../blog/v1.1.2">v1.1.2</a>)
