At Server Manager Development, we strive to bring new features to Server Manager. These new features are stable, customizable, and reliable. Server admins/owners can customize these features/systems with easy-to-use configuration commands.

## Backstory
Before we were **Server Manager**, we were originally **Ticket System**. Ticket System was a ticket bot that started out small, but grew fast. It was applied for verification but sadly, [it didn't get verified](https://servermanagerbot.ml/updates/rebranding-announcement). We are taking this opportunity to make a new and better bot - a multipurpose bot. 
Developing a multipurpose bot means we can branch-out on features and do more than we originally could. 
At the moment, we don't have a ticket system in our bot, as many people have asked and requested. In the distant future, a *small* ticket system may be added to full-fill all the hearts that miss Ticket System. This will most likely be once the bot is verified. I'm (Nziie - the one writing this page) confident this bot will get verified but i'm trying to take all the procations I can to make sure it will get verified. That being, not adding a ticket system (I personally think it's bad luck ;/). We still take community feature requests on our [support server](https://discord.gg/6bCKvP24kb).
