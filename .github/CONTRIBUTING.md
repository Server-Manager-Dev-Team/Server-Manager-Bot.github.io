# Contributing to Server Manager Documentation

We appreciate all contributions to our documentation. Contributions to anything outside documentation **will be closed**

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the guide. These are guidelines, not hard rules.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Make sure you are up to date with the latest changes. It is recommended you pull the latest changes from the master branch before working on your own.
2. Make sure to test your changes before submitting a pull request.
> We recommend you use **Visual Studio Code** and preview changes on a `localhost` site, so you can see your changes and the output.
3. In the documentation you're changing, make sure to explain everything in a way that is easy to understand.
4. Make sure you follow proper grammar and spelling.
5. Try to follow the style of other documentation.
6. Try to follow git conventions. If you are not familiar with git, you can find a good tutorial [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

> Contributions to any part of the website that's **not** documentation will be denied/closed.
