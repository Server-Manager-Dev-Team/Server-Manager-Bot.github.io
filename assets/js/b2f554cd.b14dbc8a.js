This new version includes: **moderation cases**, **bug fixes**, and small changes.\\n\\n## Cases\\nCases may make a big impact on moderation in your server. With every moderation action (warn, mute, kick, ban), a case is created with a specific ID. These cases aren\'t removed when a member leaves and they don\' expire. Therefore, you can keep track of a user\'s moderation history even if they left the server. You can edit a case\'s reason and <em>proof</em> in the `/case <case_id>` command. Yes, you heard me correctly: you can attach proof to a case. Case proof is helpful long term if you doubt that there was actually proof for the action taken against someone.\\n\\n:::note\\nWarning cases are a separate system so if you remove a warning, the case tied to the warning won\'t be removed.\\n\\nPlease also note that cases can only be created and viewed by **moderators**.\\n:::\\n\\n| Command | Description | \\n| ----------------------- | ----------- |\\n| <code>/case &lt;case_id&gt;</code> | View/manage a case - **you can edit a case in this command** |\\n| <code>/createcase &lt;member&gt; &lt;reason&gt; [action=Other] [proof=image url] [duration]</code> | Create a case for a user |\\n| <code>/cases [member]</code> | View cases for the whole server or yourself |\\n\\n## Updated Warn Command\\nThe warning system now uses \\"token like\\" warning IDs and now uses an embed for a command response.\\n\\n:::danger\\n\\nIt seems like old warnings with different warning IDs don\'t seem to be valid warning IDs when trying to remove the warning, but they are in the database. **We are currently working on a fix for this**.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::info\\nCustom branded bots now support cases as of 9/11/2022\\n:::\\n\\n<br/>\\n<h3>Want to contribute to Server Manager?</h3>\\n\\n<div className=\\"pyc-hero__actions\\">\\n  <Button link=\\"https://discord.gg/6bCKvP24kb\\">Join our Support Server</Button>\\n</div>"},{"id":"v1.0.6","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/v1.0.6","source":"@site/blog/2022-8-26-v1.0.6.md","title":"Release v1.0.6","description":"Hey everyone, a new version has been released that includes 2 new suggestion commands, and a new custom branded bot commands.","date":"2022-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 26, 2022","tags":[{"label":"New Version","permalink":"/blog/tags/new-version"},{"label":"Updates","permalink":"/blog/tags/updates"}],"readingTime":1.24,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Nziie","title":"Core Developer","url":"https://nziie.is-a.dev","imageURL":"https://github.com/Nzii3.png","key":"nziie"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"v1.0.6","title":"Release v1.0.6","authors":"nziie","tags":["New Version","Updates"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Release v1.1.0","permalink":"/blog/v1.1.0"}},"content":"import Tabs from \\"@theme/Tabs\\";\\nimport TabItem from \\"@theme/TabItem\\";\\nimport Button from \'../src/components/Button\';\\n\\nHey everyone, a new version has been released that includes **2 new suggestion commands**, and a **new custom branded bot commands**.\\n\\n## Custom Branded Commands\\nFor every custom branded bot, there are **2** new commands that allow you to change the bot\'s name and avatar directly from Discord.\\n\\n| Command | Description | \\n| ----------------------- | ----------- |\\n| <code>/custom name &lt;name&gt;</code> | Set your custom branded bot\'s name in Discord |\\n| <code>/custom avatar &lt;attachment&gt;</code> | Set your custom branded bot\'s avatar in Discord |\\n\\n## Suggestion Edit Command\\nThe new suggestion edit command allows users to edit their own suggestion, only once.\\n\\n| Command | Description | \\n| ----------------------- | ----------- |\\n| <code>/suggestions edit &lt;suggestion_id&gt;</code> | This will bring up an interactive proccess to edit the suggestion |\\n\\n:::info\\nAt the moment, you can only edit the suggestion itself and not it\'s other properties.\\n:::\\n\\n## Suggestion Delete Command\\nThe new suggestion delete command allows the suggestion author or an administrator to delete a suggestion.
